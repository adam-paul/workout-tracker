# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** 2024/12/05

**Workout Log** ("the App") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how the App handles your data. By using the App, you agree to this policy.

## 1. Data Collection
The App does not collect or transmit any personal data. All data you enter into the App is stored locally on your device. 

## 2. Data Storage and Access
- The App uses the [Android Storage Access Framework (SAF)](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/providers/document-provider) to enable backup and restore functionality. This allows you to save your workout logs to a location of your choice and restore them at your discretion.
- The App does not access or modify any files outside the backup/restore process initiated by you.

## 3. Third-Party Access
The App does not share your data with third parties.

## 4. Permissions
The App may request the following permissions to enable its functionality, should you choose to employ the backup/restore feature:
- **Read/Write Access:** Used only for user-initiated backup and restore operations via the SAF. The App does not access files outside the user-specified backup location.

## 5. Security
Your data remains on your device unless you choose to back it up to a different location of your choosing. It is your responsibility to safeguard backup files. The App does not encrypt the backup files, so consider choosing secure storage.

## 6. Changes to this Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in the App's functionality or legal requirements. Updates will be posted here, with the effective date revised.
